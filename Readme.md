# Introduction
$\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{Aspid.MVVM is a high-performance MVVM framework}}$ for Unity, built on Source Generator, designed 
with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and clear separation of business logic from presentation.

The framework enables a clean architecture where the View, logic, and data are distinctly separated.
This allows programmers and designers to work in parallel without interfering with each other, enabling
teams to scale projects without descending into chaos.

## ⚡️Key Features
### Data Binding
* $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{Aspid.MVVM}}$ supports four primary data binding modes between View and ViewModel:
* $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{OneWay}}$ – Automatically updates the View when the ViewModel changes.
* $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{TwoWay}}$ – Bidirectional synchronization between View and ViewModel.
* $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{OneTime}}$ – Sets the value once during initialization.
* $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{OneWayToSource}}$ – Updates the ViewModel when the View changes.

Binding modes can be easily specified:
* In the **View**: Directly via the Unity Inspector.
* In the **ViewModel**: Using attributes to restrict allowed binding modes.

$\color{#4fa35d}\large{\textbf{Bindings operate without reflection or boxing/unboxing, ensuring high performance.}}$

### ViewModel
With the built-in Source Generator, you can bind any data type:
* No need to inherit from specialized base classes.
* No wrappers or wrapped properties required.
* No boilerplate code, using attributes for configuration.

### Commands
A power command mechanism:
* Supports up to four parameters — simply select the desired signature.
* The `[RelayCommand]` attribute transforms a regular method into a command with `CanExecute` support.

### Observable Collections
A set of flexible, covariant observable collections:
* `ObservableList<T>`
* `ObservableDictionary<TKey, TValue>`
* `ObservableHasSet<T>`
* `ObservableStack<T>`
* `ObservableQueue<T>`

Features:
* Easy synchronization between two dependent collections.
* Support for filtering and sorting without modifying the source collection.

### StarterKit
A ready-to-use set of components for a quick start:
* $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{Binders}}$: Quickly connect to the desired component property.
* $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{Value Converters}}$: Transform values for display without altering the ViewModel.
* $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{List Components}}$: Including:
  * $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{Virtualized List}}$: Efficiently handles thousands of elements.
* $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{Dynamic ViewModel}}$: For simple structured data without writing a specialized ViewModel.
* $\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{View Initialization Components}}$: Initialize Views by ViewModel via the Unity Inspector, with support for popular DI frameworks: Zenject, VContainer.

### Convenient Debugging:
* View and modify ViewModel state directly in the Unity Inspector, even for plain C# classes.
* `[BinderLog]` attribute for automatic logging of value changes.
* Clear visual errors in the editor for incorrect bindings.

### High Performance
$\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{Aspid.MVVM}}$ is designed with performance in mind:
* No reflection in bindings.
* No boxing/unboxing when passing values.
* Minimized memory allocations.

### Extensibility
The framework is easily extensible:
* Create custom binders, converters, components, and more.
* Extend the framework to suit project needs without modifying its core.

### Cross-Platform Support
$\color{#6aba7d}\large{\textbf{Aspid.MVVM}}$ works on all Unity-supported platforms:
* PC, mobile devices, consoles.
* Create different Views for different platforms without changing the ViewModel or business logic.
