# Unity

<mark style="color:$warning;">`Aspid.MVVM.Unity`</mark> package contains all the necessary components for integrating <mark style="color:$primary;">**Aspid.MVVM**</mark> with Unity, while <mark style="color:$warning;">`Aspid.MVVM.StarterKit.Unity`</mark> package provides an extensive set of pre-built binders for Unity.

* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Aspid.MVVM.Unity**</mark>: This package includes the core components required to use the <mark style="color:$primary;">**Aspid.MVVM**</mark> framework within Unity, enabling seamless data binding and MVVM pattern implementation in Unity development. It integrates with Unityâ€™s component-based architecture, to structure View logic and communication between Views and ViewModels.
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Aspid.MVVM.StarterKit.Unity:**</mark> This package extends <mark style="color:$warning;">`Aspid.MVVM.Unity`</mark> by offering a comprehensive collection of ready-to-use binders tailored for common components, such as <mark style="color:$warning;">`Text`</mark>, <mark style="color:$warning;">`Image`</mark>, <mark style="color:$warning;">`Slider`</mark>, and others. These binders simplify binding Unity components to ViewModel properties, reducing the need for custom binder implementations. For example, binders like <mark style="color:$warning;">`ImageSpriteBinder`</mark> or <mark style="color:$warning;">`TextBinder`</mark> (as seen in previous sections) are likely included to handle specific Unity UI elements efficiently.
