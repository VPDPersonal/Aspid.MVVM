# About the Author

My name is <mark style="color:$primary;">**Vladislav Panin**</mark>, a developer with over seven years of experience in Unity. Throughout my career, I have explored various architectural patterns, such as MVC and MVP, and tested numerous frameworks for separating logic in projects. Despite their strengths, I encountered limitations when working on large-scale projects with big teams. To address these challenges, I developed <mark style="color:$primary;">**Aspid.MVVM**</mark>â€”a high-performance MVVM framework that simplifies the creation of complex Views, enhances debugging with built-in tools, and optimizes team collaboration.
